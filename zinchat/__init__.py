"""ZinChat package initialization.

This package contains the modules necessary to run a minimal demo of
ZinChat. The demo showcases a simple webâ€‘based chat server implemented
with FastAPI and WebSocket support. It also includes a tiny IoT
device simulator that responds to commands and periodically reports
sensor data.  See ``README.md`` in this directory for a high level
overview of the project and usage instructions.
